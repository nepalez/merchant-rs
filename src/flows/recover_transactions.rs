/// Payment gateway trait for disaster recovery via transaction search.
///
/// Supports searching for transactions by idempotence key when the transaction ID was lost
/// due to system failure, database rollback, or network interruption before persistence.
///
/// # When to Use
///
/// * **System crash**: Application crashed after transaction but before saving ID
/// * **Database rollback**: Transaction committed at gateway but database transaction rolled back
/// * **Network failure**: Response received but network dropped before processing
/// * **Duplicate detection**: Find previous transactions with same idempotence key
///
/// # Search Behavior
///
/// Returns async iterator because idempotence key may match multiple transactions:
/// * Network retries may create duplicate transactions
/// * Same idempotence key might be reused (though not recommended)
/// * Results may span multiple pages requiring pagination
///
/// Client must deduplicate results as gateway cannot guarantee uniqueness within a page.
///
/// # Gateway Support
///
/// Not all gateways support transaction search:
/// * **Support**: Stripe, Braintree, PayPal
/// * **No support**: Adyen, crypto processors, voucher systems
