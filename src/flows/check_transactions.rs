/// Base mandatory trait for all payment gateway adapters.
///
/// Every gateway adapter must implement this trait as the minimal requirement.
/// Provides transaction status lookup by ID, which is universally supported by all payment gateways.
///
/// # Purpose
///
/// * **Webhook verification**: Validate transaction status from webhook notifications
/// * **Reconciliation**: Match gateway transactions with internal records
/// * **Customer support**: Investigate transaction status for support inquiries
/// * **Status polling**: Check completion status for external payment flows
/// * **Audit compliance**: Retrieve transaction trail for audit purposes
///
/// # Implementation Note
///
/// This is the only mandatory trait - all payment flow traits (`ImmediatePayments`,
/// `DeferredPayments`, etc.) are optional based on gateway capabilities.
