/// Payment gateway trait for asynchronous external payment flows.
///
/// Supports payment methods where the transaction is initiated but not immediately completed.
/// The payment completion happens outside the direct flow through customer redirect, webhook, or other async mechanism.
///
/// # Flow
///
/// 1. **Initiate**: Create transaction and receive payment completion data
/// 2. **External Completion**: Customer completes payment through redirect/voucher/QR code
/// 3. **Status Check**: Poll transaction status via `CheckTransaction` trait
/// 4. **Webhook**: Receive async notification of completion (if supported by gateway)
///
/// # Payment Completion Methods
///
/// * **Redirect**: Customer redirected to payment provider (BNPL, online banking)
/// * **Voucher**: Customer receives code to pay at physical location (cash vouchers)
/// * **QR Code**: Customer scans code with mobile banking app
/// * **Bank Transfer**: Customer makes manual transfer with reference number
///
/// # Usage
///
/// The client application should:
/// * Display `payment_data` to guide customer through completion
/// * Poll transaction status using `CheckTransaction::status()`
/// * Handle webhook notifications for async status updates
/// * Retrieve payment data again via `payment_data()` if needed for retry
///
/// # Type Parameter
///
/// * `Source` - Payment source type constrained to external sources (vouchers, BNPL, etc.)
