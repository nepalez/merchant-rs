/// Direct Bank Account
///
/// ## Overview
///
/// Automated recurring debits from a customer's bank account based on a pre-authorized mandate.
/// Funds are pulled by the merchant on a schedule (subscriptions, utility bills, loan payments).
/// Settlement typically takes 1â€“3 business days.
/// Customer must provide explicit authorization through mandate setup.
///
/// ## When to Use
///
/// - **Subscription billing**: Monthly/annual recurring charges
/// - **Utility bills**: Electricity, water, internet, phone services
/// - **Loan payments**: Mortgage, car loans, student loans
/// - **Membership fees**: Gym memberships, professional associations
/// - **Insurance premiums**: Regular insurance payments
///
/// ## Authentication Model
///
/// > Authentication occurs **outside** the authorization flow, not during a transaction!
///
/// ### Pre-Authorization Methods
///
/// 1. **Micro-deposits verification** (Stripe, Plaid):
/// - Gateway sends two small deposits (e.g., $0.32 and $0.45) to the customer's account
/// - Customer verifies amounts in their bank statement
/// - Customer confirms amounts to gateway
/// - Proves the customer controls the account
///
/// 2. **Instant verification** (Plaid, Yodlee, Tink):
/// - Customer redirected to bank aggregator
/// - Customer logs into a bank through the aggregator's secure interface
/// - Aggregator confirms account ownership and validity
/// - Instant verification without waiting for deposits
///
/// 3. **Mandate authorization**:
/// - Customer signs a direct debit mandate (electronic or physical)
/// - Mandate authorizes merchant to initiate debits
/// - Mandate stored by gateway and/or merchant
/// - NACHA rules (US), Bacs rules (UK), etc. govern mandate requirements
///
/// ### Authorization Flow
///
/// The authorization request contains **only account identification data**,
/// not authentication credentials. Authentication already occurred during mandate setup.
/// Gateway verifies:
/// - Mandate exists and is valid
/// - Account is active
/// - Sufficient funds available (optional pre-notification)
///
/// ## Standards
///
/// - **NACHA Operating Rules**: National Automated Clearing House Association (United States ACH)
/// - **Bacs Payment Schemes**: Direct Debit scheme (United Kingdom)
/// - **Payments Canada Rule H1**: Pre-Authorized Debit (PAD) framework
/// - **[EFT Code of Conduct](https://www.asic.gov.au/regulatory-resources/financial-services/eft-code-of-conduct/)**: Electronic Funds Transfer (Australia)
/// - **GIRO**: Interbank GIRO system (Singapore)
/// - **CNP Standards**: China National Payment System
/// - **Zengin System**: Japanese bank clearing network
///
/// ## Example Systems
///
/// ### North America
/// - **ACH** (United States): NACHA rules, 1-2-day settlement
/// - **PAD** (Canada): Payments Canada Rule H1, 1-2-day settlement
/// - **AFT** (Mexico): Automated Funds Transfer
///
/// ### Europe
/// - **BACS** (UK): 3-day settlement, Direct Debit Guarantee
/// - **Lastschrift** (Germany): SEPA Direct Debit variant
/// - **Incasso** (Netherlands): SEPA Direct Debit variant
///
/// ### Asia Pacific
/// - **GIRO** (Singapore): Automated clearing house
/// - **Zengin** (Japan): Japanese bank clearing network
/// - **eNETS** (Singapore): Electronic Network for EFT Services
///
/// ### Other
/// - **EFT** (Australia): ASIC regulated
/// - **Autogiro** (Sweden): Swedish direct debit
/// - **Betalingsservice** (Denmark): Danish direct debit
///
/// ## Security Considerations
///
/// ### PCI DSS Compliance
/// Bank account numbers are **not** classified as Sensitive Authentication Data (SAD) under PCI DSS. However, they are critical PII and financial access data.
///
/// ### Fraud Prevention
/// - Verify account ownership through micro-deposits or instant verification
/// - Validate routing numbers against known bank databases
/// - Check account holder name matching
/// - Monitor for unusual patterns (multiple attempts, rapid changes)
/// - Implement velocity limits on failed attempts
///
/// ### Compliance
/// - **NACHA**: Must comply with Operating Rules, including authorization requirements
/// - **Bacs**: Must be registered Service User, follow Direct Debit Guarantee
/// - **PSD2** (Europe): AML/KYC requirements for account verification
/// - **GDPR**: Bank account data is PII, must follow data protection regulations
